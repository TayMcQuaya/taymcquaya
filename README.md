# TayMcQuaya - Developer & Pixel Artist

**Welcome to the official repository of TayMcQuaya!**  
I'm a passionate developer and pixel artist, creating projects that merge creativity and technology. This repository contains the source code and files for my personal portfolio website, which showcases my skills in game development, pixel art, Web3 projects, and more. Keep in mind that more self made projects are yet to come.

## üñ•Ô∏è **About Me**

Hi there! I'm TayMcQuaya, a Turkish-born, Germany-raised creator currently living in Bali. My journey in tech and art has led me to explore various fields, including **game development, pixel art, and Web3 technologies**. With a deep passion for learning, I specialize in:

- **Game Development**: I create 2D pixel art games that are simple, fun, and challenging. Check out my game *Flopy Tromp 2D*! More Games yet to come!
- **Pixel Art**: I bring characters and scenes to life one pixel at a time. My website showcases several of my **pixel art & NFT projects** i contributed to.
- **Web Development**: I build creative websites, Web3 integrations, and more. I've worked on various projects, including the **Web3Resort** in Portugal.
- **AI Enthusiast**: I love experimenting with the latest AI technologies and incorporating them into my projects.

I'm a self-taught developer who left college to pursue a more practical and exciting approach to learning. In my free time, I also enjoy exploring the crypto world and investing in NFTs.
